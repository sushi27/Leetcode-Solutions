# LeetCode Solutions and Daily Challenges

Welcome to the LeetCode Solutions and Daily Challenges repository! This repository is dedicated to providing solutions for LeetCode problems and daily challenges. It aims to serve as a valuable resource for individuals who are practicing coding interviews or looking to enhance their problem-solving skills.

## About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular online platform that offers a vast collection of coding problems to help programmers prepare for job interviews. It covers a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, making it an excellent resource for honing your coding skills.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized in the following structure:
```
- src/main/java
  - algorithms/
    - [Problem Number]/
      - [Solution].java
      - [Problem Name].txt
      - ...
    - ...
  - challenges/
    - [Problem Number]/
      - [Solution].java
      - [Problem Name].txt
      - ...
    - ...
```
The repository is divided into two main directories: `algorithms` and `challenges`.

- The `algorithms` directory contains solutions for LeetCode algorithmic problems. Each problem has its own directory, named after the `Problem{Leetcode Prblem Number}`. Inside each problem directory, you can find one or more solutions to that problem, named as `[Solution 1].java`, `[Solution 2].java`, and so on.

- The `challenges` directory contains solutions for LeetCode daily challenges. Similar to the algorithmic problems, each challenge has its own directory named after the LettCode problem number. Inside each challenge directory, you can find one or more solutions to that challenge, named as `[Solution 1].java`, `[Solution 2].java`, and so on.
